🧩 Project Description: "The Useless Auth App" (or whatever name you settle on)
At first glance, it's just another login/signup flow. A clean login page and a pretty-looking signup page — what could go wrong?

But the moment you try to create a password, the real experience begins.

This project is a deceptively elegant authentication system that turns the act of signing up into a puzzle-solving challenge. Instead of letting users pick any password, the system forces them through a series of 16 logic-based questions, each validating a part of the final password.

Only after successfully navigating all validation steps can the user complete the signup process. Once done, they’re rewarded with access to a minimal landing page and the option to download a certificate — for sheer patience and perseverance.

It’s not about security.
It’s not about practicality.
It’s about ✨ enduring the process ✨.


🔧 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)
Some websites act like guarding a nuclear launch code when you’re just trying to sign up to read an article.
We’re sarcastically solving this non-existent crisis by showing just how far password validation can go — and then going way farther.

Because why stop at one “uppercase + symbol + number” requirement, when you can solve 16 handcrafted validation riddles to unlock your account?

This project pokes fun at extreme signup hurdles, all under the disguise of a professional-looking interface — until it’s too late.


🧪 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
We fight absurd password rules the only way that makes sense — by going full chaos.

Our strategy? Give them a taste of their own medicine — but sugarcoated.
You want validation? We’ve got 16 questions, each more irrational than the last, standing between you and your precious password.

We turned “signing up” into a mini psychological endurance test, complete with a certificate for surviving it.

In short: if you thought password rules were annoying, wait till you try our solution. 💅
