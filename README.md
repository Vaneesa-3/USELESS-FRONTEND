## 🧩 Project Description: **"The Useless Auth App"**

At first glance, it's just another login/signup flow. A clean login page and a pretty-looking signup page — what could go wrong?

But the moment you try to create a password, the real experience begins.

This project is a deceptively elegant authentication system that turns the act of signing up into a **puzzle-solving challenge**. Instead of letting users pick any password, the system forces them through a series of **16 logic-based questions**, each validating a part of the final password.

Only after successfully navigating all validation steps can the user complete the signup process. Once done, they’re rewarded with access to a **minimal landing page** and the option to **download a certificate** — for sheer patience and perseverance.

> It’s not about security.  
> It’s not about practicality.  
> It’s about ✨ enduring the process ✨.

## 🔧 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

Some websites act like they’re guarding nuclear launch codes when you’re just trying to sign up to read an article.

We’re sarcastically solving this **non-existent crisis** by showing just how far password validation can go — and then going **way farther**.

Because why stop at one “uppercase + symbol + number” requirement, when you can solve **16 handcrafted validation riddles** to unlock your account?

This project **pokes fun at extreme signup hurdles**, all under the disguise of a professional-looking interface — until it’s too late.

## 🧪 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We fight absurd password rules the only way that makes sense — by going **full chaos**.

Our strategy? Give them a taste of their own medicine — but sugarcoated.  
You want validation? We’ve got **16 questions**, each more irrational than the last, standing between you and your precious password.

We turned signing up into a **mini psychological endurance test**, complete with a **certificate for surviving it**.

> In short: if you thought password rules were annoying, wait till you try our solution. 💅

Explain what the video demonstrates
🧪 Video Demonstration Summary
The video showcases Credence, a satirical authentication system with a deceptively polished UI. On attempting signup, users face a randomized series of 16 chaotic password validation checks. The questions appear in no fixed order, and each repeats until its specific requirement is fulfilled — turning the signup process into a frustrating yet funny puzzle. Once all criteria are satisfied, the user reaches a minimalist landing page with the option to download a certificate of survival, celebrating their endurance through the absurd validation ordeal.
